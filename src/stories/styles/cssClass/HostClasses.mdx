# Overview

`hostClasses` is a utility function offered by `ng-badger` that simplifies the manipulation of CSS classes on the component host in your Angular application. This function provides a lightweight and efficient alternative to Angular's `@HostBinding`, without triggering change detection.

## Key Benefits

- **No Change Detection Overhead:** `hostClasses` does not incur change detection overhead, making it an efficient solution for managing host classes.

- **Descriptive and Readable:** You can enhance the readability and clarity of your code by using `hostClasses` to clearly define how classes are added or removed.

With `hostClasses`, you can streamline the management of CSS classes on your component host, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code while avoiding unnecessary change detection.

## Usage

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {hostClasses} from "ng-badger";
import {CssClasses} from "ng-badger";

@Component({
    selector: 'example',
    template: '...',
    standalone: true
})
export class ExampleComponent {

    private readonly backgroundClasses: CssClasses = hostClasses('initial-class');

}
```

When you call `hostClasses`, it returns a CssClasses object. This object provides a set of methods that allow you to efficiently manipulate the CSS classes of the component host in your Angular application. These methods enable you to add, remove, or modify classes as needed, all while maintaining code readability and avoiding change detection overhead.

    <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Description</th>

    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>`set(...cssClasses: string[]): void;`</td>
        <td>Replace all existing classes in instance of `CssClasses` object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`add(...cssClasses: string[]): void;`</td>
        <td>Add class to instance of `CssClasses` object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`get(): string[];`</td>
        <td>Get all set classes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`contains(cssClass: string): boolean;`</td>
        <td>Check if class is set</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`remove(...cssClasses: string[]): void;`</td>
        <td>Remove css classes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`removeAll(): void;`</td>
        <td>Remove all classes set in instance of `CssClasses`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`swap(...cssClasses: string[]): string[];`</td>
        <td>Swap all classes. It works as remove all and set new classes. Method returns previously set classes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`toggle(...cssClasses: string[]): void;`</td>
        <td>Add class if not set, remove if set.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`toString(): string;`</td>
        <td>Join all classes to a string. String format: `class1 class2 class3`</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

It's important to note that all methods provided by the `CssClasses` object are designed to work exclusively on the instance of `CssClasses` they are called on. For instance, if you use the `removeAll` method, it will only remove classes that were previously added or manipulated using methods within the same instance of `CssClasses`. Classes added using other instances or approaches will not be affected.

This scope limitation ensures that class management is precise and isolated to the specific instance of `CssClasses`, offering a controlled and predictable way to handle CSS classes within your Angular application.

In your Angular component, you have the flexibility to create and use multiple instances of the CssClasses object. Each instance can be associated with different elements or components, allowing for independent class management and customization as needed. This approach enhances the versatility and control of CSS class manipulation within your application.

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {hostClasses} from "ng-badger";
import {CssClasses} from "ng-badger";

@Component({
    selector: 'example',
    template: '...',
    standalone: true
})
export class ExampleComponent {

    private readonly backgroundClasses: CssClasses = hostClasses('initial-class');
    private readonly borderClasses: CssClasses = hostClasses();
    private readonly shadowClasses: CssClasses = hostClasses();

}
```
