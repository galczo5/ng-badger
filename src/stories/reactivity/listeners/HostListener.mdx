```

# Overview

`hostListener` is designed to streamline event handling in your Angular application, in the spirit of Angular's `@HostListener`. However, unlike conventional event listeners, `hostListener` takes advantage of RxJS observables, enabling you to use a wide array of operators to control and manipulate events. This results in a more reactive and expressive codebase, making it easier to respond to user interactions and changes in your application.

## Key Advantages

- **Reactive Event Handling:** With `hostListener`, events become reactive streams, providing you with the power to use RxJS operators to respond to and manipulate events in a declarative and efficient way.

- **Enhanced Code Readability:** By leveraging reactive programming, `hostListener` makes your code more expressive and readable, allowing you to create event-driven logic that is easier to understand and maintain.

- **Adaptability:** `hostListener` equips you with the tools to dynamically respond to events and user interactions, ensuring that your application remains adaptable and responsive.

## Usage

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {AsyncPipe, CommonModule} from "@angular/common";
import {hostListener} from "ng-badger";
import {map} from "rxjs";

@Component({
  selector: 'example',
  template: '{{ click$ | async }}',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, AsyncPipe]
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  click$ = hostListener('click')
    .pipe(
        map(() => 'click!')
    );
}

```
