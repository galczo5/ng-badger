# Overview

`cssClassesFactory` extends the capabilities of `hostClasses` by providing you with the freedom to specify the element to which you want to apply or modify CSS classes. This feature is particularly valuable when you need to manage classes on elements other than the component host.

## Key Benefits

- **Element Flexibility:** With `cssClassesFactory`, you can select any element in your Angular application, allowing for greater control over class manipulation.

- **No Change Detection Overhead:** Similar to `hostClasses`, `cssClassesFactory` does not trigger change detection, ensuring efficient class management.

This provides you with an overview of `cssClassesFactory` and its advantages before delving into the specific instructions on how to use it. If you'd like to see the "How to Use" section, please let me know, and I'll provide that part as well.

## Usage

```typescript
import {Component,ElementRef,OnInit,ViewChild} from "@angular/core";
import {CommonModule} from "@angular/common";
import {CssClasses,cssClassesFactory} from "ng-badger";

@Component({
  selector: 'example',
  template: '<div #el></div>',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule]
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {

  @ViewChild('el', {static: true, read: ElementRef})
  child!: ElementRef;

  backgroundClasses!: CssClasses;

  private readonly cssFactory = cssClassesFactory();

  ngOnInit() {
    this.backgroundClasses = this.cssFactory(this.child)(['initial-class']);
  }
}
```
