# Overview:

`hostStyles` is a valuable function within the `ng-badger` library, designed to simplify the management of styles for the component host in your Angular application. This function operates in a manner similar to `hostClasses`, providing an efficient and descriptive way to manipulate styles on the component host without triggering change detection.

## Key Benefits:

- **No Change Detection Overhead:** With `hostStyles`, you can efficiently apply, add, or remove styles to the component host without incurring any change detection overhead, ensuring optimal performance.

- **Descriptive and Readable:** `hostStyles` enhances the readability and maintainability of your code by allowing you to express how styles are applied or modified in a clear and descriptive manner, making your code more self-explanatory and easier to understand.

These benefits make `hostStyles` a valuable tool for managing styles on the component host in a more efficient, expressive, and performance-friendly way within your Angular application.

## Usage

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {hostStyles, Styles} from "ng-badger";

@Component({
    selector: 'example',
    template: '...',
    standalone: true
})
export class ExampleComponent {

    private readonly backgroundStyles: Styles = hostStyles({ background: 'red' });

}
```


The `hostStyles` function offers a comprehensive set of methods to add, remove, and manage styles for the component host within your Angular application. These methods provide you with fine-grained control over the styling of your component host, enhancing the versatility and precision of your styling tasks.

`hostStyles` harnesses the full potential of TypeScript's type system to ensure that all styles are meticulously typed. This approach alleviates the concern of misspelled or incorrect CSS properties, providing a robust and reliable solution for managing styles in your Angular application.

By leveraging TypeScript's type system, `hostStyles` offers the following advantages:

- **Type Safety:** Styles are checked against their correct typings, preventing errors due to misspelled properties or incorrect value types.

- **Code Completion:** TypeScript's autocompletion features make it easier to explore and apply styles, enhancing developer productivity.

- **Compile-Time Validation:** Style-related issues are identified and resolved at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors related to styling.

This emphasis on type safety and TypeScript's features significantly improves the robustness and correctness of your application's styles, contributing to a smoother development experience. With `hostStyles`, you can confidently manage your styles, knowing that the type system has your back.

It's important to note that all methods within the `hostStyles` function are confined to the respective `Styles` object they are called on. This means that when you use the `removeAll` method, it exclusively removes the styles that were set within the same `Styles` object. Styles applied using different instances or other styling methods remain unaffected.

This method scope restriction allows for precision and isolation in style management, facilitating the use of multiple `Styles` objects or alternative styling techniques as needed. With this approach, you have the flexibility to tailor your styling strategy to your specific requirements and maintain a well-organized and granular approach to managing styles in your Angular application.

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {hostStyles, Styles} from "ng-badger";

@Component({
    selector: 'example',
    template: '...',
    standalone: true
})
export class ExampleComponent {

    private readonly backgroundStyles: Styles = hostStyles({ background: 'red' });
    private readonly textStyles: Styles = hostStyles({ color: 'white' });

}
```
