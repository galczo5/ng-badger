<Meta title="Styles/ Style / stylesFactory"/>

```javascript
import {stylesFactory} from 'ng-badger';
```

# Overview:

`stylesFactory` extends the capabilities of `hostStyles` by giving you control over the `ElementRef` where styles should be applied or manipulated. This is particularly valuable when you need to manage styles on elements beyond the component host, providing you with a wide range of styling possibilities.

## Key Benefits:

- **Element Flexibility:** With `stylesFactory`, you can select any `ElementRef` in your Angular application, allowing for greater control over style management.

- **No Change Detection Overhead:** Similar to `hostStyles`, `stylesFactory` does not trigger change detection, ensuring efficient style management.

## Usage

```typescript
import {Component, ElementRef, OnInit, ViewChild} from "@angular/core";
import {Styles, stylesFactory} from "ng-badger";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  template: '<div #el></div>',
  standalone: true
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {

  @ViewChild('el', {read: ElementRef, static: true})
  child!: ElementRef;

  style!: Styles;

  private factory = stylesFactory();

  ngOnInit() {
    this.style = this.factory(this.child)({color: 'initial'});
  }
}
```

The usage of `stylesFactory` is similar to that of `hostStyles`. For detailed instructions and examples on how to utilize `stylesFactory` for managing styles within your Angular application, please refer to the documentation for `hostStyles`. It provides comprehensive information on the common approach and methods shared between both functions, ensuring that you can efficiently manage styles while maintaining code readability and performance.
